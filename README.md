# Debugging Demo
A simple project to be used to demonstrate basic debugging in Qt Creator.

1. Open project in QTC
2. Set a breakpoint in the `push_back` loop.
3. Run the project in debug.
4. Open `my\_vec` in the memory window. Set the display value for data to array of length 10.
5. Use 'Step Over' for a few iterations to show values updating.
6. Use 'Step Into' to enter the `push_back()` method. Then come back to main.
7. Right click on the breakpoint to disable it.
8. Set a new breakpoint at the top of the print loop.
9. Use 'Continue' to advance to the new breakpoint.
10. Use 'Continue' to finish the program.
